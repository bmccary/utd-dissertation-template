Brady C McCary was born in Texas in the Fall of 1982, much to his own surprise.
He went to The Colony High School as a high school lower classman and the 
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science (TAMS) as a high school upper classman.
At TAMS, Brady discovered that he was destined to be a sort of mathematician,
owing to the finding that the busy work in other disciplines was more than his
customs allowed at that time.
Simultaneously, Brady discovered the joy of programming, which significantly
increased the amount of effort he exerted at any given time. Most of this effort
was spent in avoidance of (otherwise) busy work. These kind of adventures
and mannerisms generally lead his friends and family to laugh at quotes like the following.

        Some of you may have met mathematicians and wondered how they got that way.

    \end{minipage}
\end{flushright}

After TAMS, Brady went to Southern Methodist University for one semester
before transferring to Texas A\&M University (TAMU). Simultaneously, Brady applied
and was accepted to the Mathematics Advanced Study Semester program at Penn State University (MASS)
and the Research in Industrial Projects for Students program (RIPS) at the
Institute for Pure \& Applied Mathematics at the University of California,
Los Angeles. After making it back to TAMU, Brady participated in a few
Summer programs under the National Science Foundation title
\emph{Vertical Integration of Research and Education in the Mathematical Sciences} (VIGRE).
Eventually, Brady graduated from TAMU with a BS in Applied Mathematics.

After a brief tour in a programming job and being trained as a firefighter,
Brady entered graduate school in the PhD program in applied mathematical
sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). While at UTD, Brady
received the Graduate Studies Scholarship (GSS). Brady was a teaching
assistant, mostly helping Dr. Frank Allum with calculus I and calculus II.
Brady received the teaching assistant of the year award in 2008, and then
received the Excellence in Education Fellowship in 2009 and 2010.
Brady's first publication was \citep{mccary:ssiai-2010}, which was the
inspiration for this report. In turn, the contents of this report are
being prepared into a manuscript for publication in a journal.

During graduate school, Brady met his wife, got married, moved four 
times, had a son, and expects a daughter not long after the writing of this report.
Brady's latest accomplishment is writing exactly 409 words in third person about himself, 
ending in a sentence with exactly 224 characters, including whitespace, punctuation 
and numbers, followed by his permanent address.
