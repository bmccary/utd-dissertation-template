This is a UTD dissertation template made for your
convenience by Brady C McCary. Feel free to use
it according to the terms in the LICENSE file.

Notes.

1. These are the exact dimension, spacing and
punctuation requirements of the graduate office
as of 2012-04-10.

2. This template requires a recent version of
latex. I use pdflatex on a recent linux
distribution.

3. I might be willing to help you, but don't
expect me to help you.

4. I won't help you if you are using anything
except pdflatex. 

5. MiKTeX uses pdflatex, so MiKTeX is OK.
However, you MUST make sure you are compling
directly to PDF, not to DVI and then converting
to PDF.

	Yes: TeX -> PDF
	No: TeX -> DVI -> PDF
	No: TeX -> PS -> PDF

5. To compile your dissertation in linux, just 
type make at the command line.

6. You will have to study the structure of this
template in order to understand it. Sorry, but
no one promised you this would be easy.
