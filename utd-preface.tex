This dissertation was produced in accordance with guidelines which permit the inclusion
as part of the dissertation the text of an original paper or papers submitted for
publication. The dissertation must still conform to all other requirements explained
in the Guide for the Preparation of Master's Theses and Doctoral Dissertations at
The University of Texas at Dallas. It must include a comprehensive abstract, a full
introduction and literature review and an overall conclusion. Additional material
(procedural and design data as well as descriptions of equipment) must be provided
in sufficient detail to allow a clear and precise judgment to be made of the importance
and originality of the research reported.

It is acceptable for this dissertation to include as chapters authentic copies of papers
already published, provided these meet type size, margin and legibility requirements.
In such cases, connecting texts which provide logical bridges between different
manuscripts are mandatory. Where the student is not the sole author of a manuscript,
the student is required to make an explicit statement in the introductory material to
that manuscript describing the student's contribution to the work and acknowledging
the contribution of the other author(s). The signatures of the Supervising Committee
which precede all other material in the dissertation attest to the accuracy of this
statement.
